    "# Intro to Bookworm\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Infinite Jest is a very long and complicated novel. There are a lot of brilliant resources connected to the book, which aim to help the reader stay afloat amongst the chaos of David Foster Wallace's obscure language, interwoven timelines and narratives, and the sprawling networks of characters. The [Infinite Jest Wiki](http://infinitejest.wallacewiki.com/david-foster-wallace/index.php?title=Infinite_Jest_Page_by_Page), for example, is insanely well documented and I'd recommend it to anyone reading the book.  \n",
    "One of the most interesting resources I found while reading was Sam Potts' [Infinite Jest Diagram](http://www.sampottsinc.com/ij/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://a.fastcompany.net/upload/IJ_Diagram-Huge-A.jpg \"IJmap\")\n",
    "\n",
    "I went back to the image once or twice while I was reading IJ to work out who a character was and how they were connected to the scene. It's a fun resource to have access to while reading something so deliberately scattered.  \n",
    "However, Infinite Jest isn't the only \"big\" book out there, and as far as I know the network above was drawn up entirely by hand. I thought it would be nice to have something like this for anything I was reading. It might also function as an interesting learning resource - either for kids at a young, early-reader stage with simple books and small character networks, or for people learning about network analysis who have never bothered reading [Les Miserables](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045) (again, as far as I know all of the standard example graph datasets like Les Mis and The Karate Kid were put together entirely by hand).  \n",
    "I thought that with a bit of thought and testing, this process was probably automatable, and it is. I can now feed bookworm any novel and have it churn out a pretty network like the one above in seconds, without any prior knowledge of the story or its characters. By virtue of the way character connections are measured, it can also tell you the relative strength of all links between characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "Before we start, let's import all of the code in the [bookworm module](bookworm/). I'll explain what each function does as we move through the notebook - we'll be covering most of [build_network.py](bookworm/build_network.py) here."

    "- `get_character_sequences()` uses python builtins to split it into substrings of length `n` (default 200).  \n",
